# signalk-sbd

Sending data from the SignalK server via Iridium SBD (Short Burst Data). Use with RockBlock or Iridium 9602 modems.

Currently sending position, speedOverGround, courseOverGroundTrue, headingMagnetic, waterTemp, windSpeed.

Most of this code was created before I was using SignalK so some of the conversions between units are nonsensical.
